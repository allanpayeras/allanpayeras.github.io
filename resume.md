## Skills

* Programming languages: Python, C++, shell script.
* Data analysis frameworks: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, ROOT (CERN).
* Machine learning / deep learning frameworks: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, LangChain.
* Theoretical background: statistics, probability, calculus, linear algebra, mathematical modeling, physics.
* Other computational resources: git, Linux, LaTex.

I am interested in learning new computational and mathematical tools relevant to achieve the goals of projects I am involved with as well as effectively communicating my findings to stakeholders. Given my academic background, the learning process is rapid and efficient.


## Professional experience

**PhD Candidate**\
*University of Campinas*\
*Aug/2018 - Dec/2023, Brazil*

* Developed a data pipeline with bash scripts and C++ in a high performance computing environment (in Linux) to generate simulated data regarding the detection of high-energy cosmic rays with the AugerPrime Observatory.
* Developed a nonlinear regression model using Python to predict signals due to muons within the AugerPrime detectors. The model exhibits a bias below 5%, validated with Monte Carlo simulations.
* Using Python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Scipy), the potential of the aforementioned model to identify light and heavy species of cosmic rays was demonstrated, quantified by merit factors above 1. This experimental resolution in composition is the primary aim of the upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory, which will facilitate future scientific insights into the astrophysical nature of high-energy cosmic rays.
* These findings were documented in technical notes of the Auger Collaboration and presented in international meetings for leading experts in the field of cosmic rays.


**PhD Intern**\
*Karlsruhe Institute of Technology*\
*Nov/2021 - Nov/2022, Germany*

* Implemented algorithms in C++ to calibrate and process signals of AugerPrime detectors which were included in the official framework of the Auger Collaboration (hosted in GitLab).
These implementations rendered the framework compatible with data of the upgraded detectors of the Observatory.

* Created an ETL pipeline with C++ and Python to combine calibration and monitoring data of AugerPrime detectors from different sources aiming at assessing the performance of the implemented calibration algorithm, which was verified as successful in more than 99.5% of the time.

* Developed a maximum likelihood method in Python which demonstrated that the nonlinearity and bias between the signals of the upgraded and former stations is below 3%, verifying the stability of the new detectors.

* Applying statistical analyses, showed that reconstruction of cosmic ray events using data of the AugerPrime Observatory exhibits less than 5% bias in energy estimation with respect to the pre-upgrade configuration of the detectors. This finding ensures compatibility and a seamless transition between the two operation phases of the Pierre Auger Observatory.


**Masters Student**\
*University of Campinas*\
*Mar/2016 - Oct/2018, Brazil*

* Using a small-area photomultiplier tube and a cross-calibration procedure in C++, the occurrence of saturation in the AugerPrime detectors was reduced to less than 0.1%.
This result enhances the quality of data collected, ultimately leading to more accurate estimations of the properties of detected high-energy cosmic rays.


**Research Intern**\
*Royal Holloway University of London*\
*Jun/2014 - Sep/2014, United Kingdom*

* Developed a linear regression model in C++ (ROOT) to correlate the invariant mass of the top quark to the corresponding decay particles as measured by the ATLAS detector in the Large Hadron Collider (CERN, Switzerland).
This study was relevant for the inference of intrinsic properties of fundamental particles.
