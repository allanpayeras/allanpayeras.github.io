As a doctoral researcher and data analyst at Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), I investigated the physical potential of data from the AugerPrime Observatory, the largest cosmic ray observatory in the world.
I have developed and implemented statistical methods and algorithms using Python, C++, and Linux to simulate and reconstruct events from high-energy cosmic rays, achieving high accuracy and performance.

With a Master of Science in Physics from UNICAMP and a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Universidade Federal do Paran√°, I have a strong background in mathematical modeling, data analysis, and astroparticle physics.
I have collaborated with the Pierre Auger Observatory since 2016, where I have contributed to different challenging research topics and communicated my findings to leading researchers within an international environment.
I have also completed a research internship at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany and an undergraduate exchange program at Royal Holloway, University of London in the UK.
I am currently interested in applying my analytical and programming skills to derive solutions as a data scientist in the industry.
