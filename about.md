        <h2>Hello, my name is Allan!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a researcher with a PhD in physics who is passionate about extracting insights and learning from data.
            I deeply appreciate how mathematical and statistical methods combine with computational resources to create powerful tools for analyses as well as predictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I started my masters in 2016, I commenced my collaboration with the Pierre Auger Observatory, the largest experiment for detection of cosmic rays in the world.
            During my doctoral research, I investigated the potential of data collected by the upgraded instruments of the Observatory to identify the composition of the most energetic cosmic particles in the Universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have developed and implemented statistical methods and algorithms using Python and C++ in Linux environments to analyze the reconstruction of high-energy cosmic ray events from data.
            My findings were communicated in conferences and meetings to leading researchers on the field within an international environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also completed a research internship at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany and an undergraduate exchange program at the Royal Holloway University of London in the United Kingdom.
            I currently live with my wife and our two cats in the San Francisco Bay Area, California.
        </p>
        <p>
            After acquiring knowledge, technical skills and experience in science, research and problem solving, I am interested in applying the latest methods and computational tools to derive meaningful solutions as a data scientist in the industry.
